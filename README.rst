The analysis of X-ray spectra often depends on the correct 
usage of instrument response files. However, these calculations 
are exclusively implemented in one of the three X-ray packages, 
all of which come with a lot of overhead. 

Here, we attempt to separate out and simplify the response calculation in 
sherpa for ease of use with any other (user-written) code.
